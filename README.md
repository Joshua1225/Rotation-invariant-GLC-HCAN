# GLC-HCAN, a Rotation-invariant point cloud recognition and retrieval method
A project for a rotation invariant point cloud analysis method by global-local-consistent hypergraph modeling. This is a repository for the method proposed in " Exploring Local and Global Consistent Correlation on Hypergraph for Rotation Invariant Point Cloud Analysis". The related resource including source code will be released soon.
